# Penguin_Tournament

- To run the solver, you can simple run all of the cells in 'MT Annealing New.ipynb'.
- For all of the inputs, a naive solver was also used as a baseline, which can be run by running the cells in 'Naive Partitioning.ipynb'.
- For inputs which did poorly, some hand tuning with the time spent and number of steps was also done with the annealing solver, by running the solve method.
